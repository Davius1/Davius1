### Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ I am David and I am looking for a job as a junior java developer.
I would like to remark that my "first name" is motivation, and the second one is hard work.
I started in this world looking for selfdevelpment and for a stable life, but I perfectly know it is not easy.
I will always be grateful to my friend @jeronimogg90 who is currently helping me with all my doubts, but I will be even more grateful with the company that would not hesitate to take me as a part of their development team.
I am a fast learner and my main objective is to become a Senior Java Developer ðŸŒ±.
